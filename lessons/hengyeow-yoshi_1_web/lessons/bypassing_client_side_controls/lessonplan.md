## Server-Side and Client-Side Functionality 

### Server-Side Functionality 
In addition to the HTTP protocol used to send messages between client and server, web applications employ numerous technologies to deliver their functionality. When a user requests a dynamic resource, the server’s response is created on the fly, and each user may receive different content tailored for them. Dynamic content is generated by scripts or other code executing on the server.

Web applications employ a wide range of technologies on the server side to deliver their functionality:

Server-Side Technologies | Description
--- | ---
Scripting languages | <u><li>PHP</li><li>VBScript</li><li>Perl</li></u>
Web application platforms | <u><li>ASP.NET</li><li>Java</li></u>
Web servers | <u><li>Apache</li><li>IIS</li><li>Netscape Enterprise</li></u>
Databases | <u><li>MS-SQL</li><li>Oracle</li><li>MySQL</li></u>
Back-end components | <u><li>Filesystems</li><li>SOAP-based web services</li><li>Directory services</li></u>

### Client-Side Functionality 
For the server-side application to receive user input and actions and present the results to the user, it needs to provide a client-side user interface. Because all web applications are accessed via a web browser, these interfaces all share a common core of technologies.

Client-Side Technologies | Description
--- | ---
HTML | Tag-based language that is used to describe the structure of documents that are rendered within the browser.
Hyperlinks | A large amount of communication from client to server is driven by the user’s clicking on hyperlinks.
Forms | HTML forms are the usual mechanism for allowing users to enter arbitrary input via their browser.
CSS | Language used to describe the presentation of a document written in a markup language. Within web applications, it is used to specify how HTML content should be rendered on-screen.
JavaScript | Programming language that is used to extend web interfaces in which the client side is used not simply to submit user data and actions but also to perform actual processing of data. <u><li>I.e. Certain tasks can be carried out entirely on the client component, without needing to make a round trip of request and response to the server.</li></u>
