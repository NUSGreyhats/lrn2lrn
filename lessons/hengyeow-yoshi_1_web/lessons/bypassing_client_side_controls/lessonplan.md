## Server-Side and Client-Side Functionality 

In addition to the HTTP protocol used to send messages between client and server, web applications employ numerous technologies to deliver their functionality. When a user requests a dynamic resource, the server’s response is created on the fly, and each user may receive different content tailored for them. Dynamic content is generated by scripts or other code executing on the server.
