## Computer Forensics

According to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_forensics):
> The goal of **Computer Forensics** is to examine digital media with the aim of identifying, preserving, recovering, analyzing and presenting facts and opinions about the digital information.

## Forensics in CTF
According to [OpenCTF](http://www.openctf.com/html/firstctf.html):
> **Digital Forensics** This is a fairly broad category. You might receive an image of a disk in FAT format, and you’ll need to un-delete “flag.txt”. Maybe you receive a zip file, that contains a 7z file, that contains a tar archive, that contains some obscure file format you’ve never heard of, and unpacking the entire chain eventually gives you a flag.
